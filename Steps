Programming with TCP/IP Sockets

    1. Create the Socket
    2. Identify the Socket
    3. Server end: wait for incoming connection
    4. Send and receive messages
    5. Close the Socket

1. Create a Socket
    Socket is created with the parameters:
        - domain/address family
        - type
        - protocol

    Domain or Address Family:
        Communication domain in which socket should be created

    Type:
        Type of service, selected according to properties required by application

    Protocol:
        Protocol to support socket operation
        Useful where some families may have more than one protocol to support a given type of service


2. Identify a Socket
    Need to assign a transport address to socket (port number IP networking)
    This is known as "binding" an address

    Defined in socket address structure
    int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);

    Socket is defined in Step 1

        struct sockaddr_in 
            { 
                __uint8_t         sin_len; 
                sa_family_t       sin_family; // Address family used to set up socket
                in_port_t         sin_port; // Port number
                struct in_addr    sin_addr; // Machine's IP address
                char              sin_zero[8]; 
            };

3. Server end: wait for incoming connection

4. Send and receive messages
